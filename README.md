# Refactoring Stock Workbook VBA Code

## Overview of Project
For Module 2, a solution code was prepared and given to Steve to help better analyze the stock his parents had invested into. The workbook created allowed for Steve to analyze the dataset with the press of one button created in the workbook. However, the dataset only contained data for only around a dozen or so stocks and Steve wants to expand it to include the entire stock market over the last few years. The solution code created may have worked efficiently for around a couple of stocks however, it may not work for thousands of stock options. Our purpose for this challenge is to refactor the code to ensure it will run in a shorter amount of time and compare the time differences with the old Module 2 solution to allow for faster analysis outputs.
